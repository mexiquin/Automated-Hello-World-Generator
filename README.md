# Automated-Hello-World-Generator
This project seeks to create a program that will write "Hello World" programs for you




## Purpose
"Hello World" programs are in high demand. We're seeing a resurgence in need for this once trite string in unsuspected
markets and even skilled colleagues are finding themselves [toiling at their creation](https://github.com/mexiquin/CS305_a5_collab) instead of addressing pressing, non-trivial problems.

<sub>Example: a starved-for-stimulation programmer desperately trying to churn out "Hello World" programs to meet global
demand<sub>
  
<br>

To ease the burden of these overworked but understimulated minds, we have set out to create a tool that will automate the production of this necessary menace.




## Goal
Our primary goal is to create a program that will do away with the scarcity of the in-demand "Hello World".


  
  
## Contributing
One of our teams is using supervised learning techniques to instruct a model what "Hello World" programs do **not** look like for the sake of creating quality control mechanisms for the rest of the project. This team has opened up part of this process to outside contributors. To contribute to this team, you may submit code that is vaguely similar to a "Hello World" program, but is incorrect. To do so, please submit your code in code blocks, like below, to our CONTRIBUTING.md file.
  
Example:
  ```python
  print( "Goodbye cruel world!" )
  # <your name here>
  ```
