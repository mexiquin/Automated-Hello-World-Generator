# Automated-Hello-World-Generator
This project seeks to create a program that will write "Hello World" programs for you




## Purpose
"Hello World" programs are in high demand. We're seeing a resurgence in need for this once trite string in unsuspected
markets and even skilled colleagues are findind themselves [toiling at their creation](https://github.com/mexiquin/CS305_a5_collab) instead of addressing pressing, non-trivial problems.

<sub>Example: a starved-for-stimulation programmer desperately trying to churn out "Hello World" programs to meet global
demand<sub>
  
<br>

To ease the burden of these overworked but understimulated minds, we have set out to create a tool that will automate the production of this necessary menace.




## Goal
Our primary goal is to create a program that will do away with the scarcity of the in-demand "Hello World".
